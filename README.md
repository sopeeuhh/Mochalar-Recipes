1. Mochalar is a website where I display a bunch of amazing recipes for sweet treats that anyone can use and learn from. they have easy to follow steps, ingredient lists, and pictures that help people make sure their end result is correct.
2. I made my project so I could help teach other people how to bake these yummy treats. Everytime I create these sweet treats, people would always ask for more, so this website could teach them how to make their own treats when I'm not availiable.
3. I made my project with HTML and CSS. I first imported most of the image files I knew I was going to use for the website. I created an outline of what I wanted my website to look like and experimented with a bunch of different designs until I found the right one. I created specific sections for each of the html files, text, and images, so it would be easy to design in css. I created recipe tiles for the cookies and the brownies using the grid thing, added the image files, and then added the text for the ingredients and recipe in a list form using the ul and li. I also added a cool nav bar with a cute logo. i added an event page where people could see how these sweet treats made a great impact in my community and how it could also do the same for others.
4. I struggled a lot with positioning in css. I would then later find it was because of a missing semicolon or overwritten code. But, I did learn how to better position the contents on the page and make it a lot more presentable.

       <h2 class="recipe-bottom-text">╰┈➤ Get Started!</h2>
       <ul class="recipe-list">
      <li>1. low heat on the stove, put your butter into a pot. let the butter bubble for about 3 minutes or until it browns and has a nutty smell. when you get your browned butter, remove from heat and transfer to a seperate bowl. add in your sugars with the butter and mix together. let the mixture cool down</li>
         <li>2. in a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, salt, baking soda, and baking powder. this is your dry ingredients </li>
         <li>3. once the butter and sugar mixture has cooled down, add in 1 full room temperature egg and 1 room temperature egg yolk into the bowl. add in the vanilla extract. add the hot water to the instant coffee and then mix that together. add the coffee mixture to the bowl. mix the wet ingredients together for about 1-2 minutes, or until the mixture has a dark brown color and thick consistency.</li>
         <li>4. with a spatula, fold the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients in two intervals. when you add in your second interval of dry ingredients, add and then fold in your chocolate chips. DO NOT OVERMIX! distribute the cookie dough into round balls and leave it in the fridge for at least an hour</li>
         <li>5. follow the instructions on your brownie box to make a nice fudgey brownie mixture. preheat your oven according to your brownie box</li>
         <li>6. layer your brownie batter at the bottom of your pan. scoop chocolate chip cookie dough blobs and plop them into the brownie batter. arrange the cookie dough blobs however you'd like! i usually put various size cookie blobs in multiple rows. bake the brookies for about 25-30 minutes (depends on what the box says)  </li>
         <li>7. let the brookies sit in the pan for about 10 minutes. using a toothpick, stick it in the brookies to check if the brookies are done baking. if the toothpick has crumbs or is incredibly wet, leave it in the oven for a few more minutes. if it toothpick is a little wet and there's no crumbs, then it is complete! ENJOY! </li>
